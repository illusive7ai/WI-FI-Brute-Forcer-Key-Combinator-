Key Combinator - Password Generator
Key Combinator is a batch script developed to generate customizable password lists based on user-defined parameters.

Features
Generates passwords of varying lengths.
Combines characters, digits, and symbols for strong password creation.


Allows user customization:
Define password lengths (minimum length of 8).
Specify the number of passwords to generate per length.
Outputs all generated passwords into a text file (passlist_raw.txt) for easy access.

How It Works
Initialization: The script sets up necessary variables and configures the password generation logic.
User Input:
Specify the maximum password length.
Indicate the number of passwords to generate per length.
Password Generation:
For each password, the script randomly selects characters, digits, or symbols.
Passwords are generated iteratively for all specified lengths.
Output:
Generated passwords are saved in passlist_raw.txt in the BF_Files directory.
The total count of generated passwords is displayed upon completion.


Requirements
Place the script in a folder containing colorchar.exe (used for colored text output).
Ensure the BF_Files directory exists in the same location as the script.


How to Use
Run the batch script (.bat file).
Enter the desired parameters when prompted:
Maximum password length.
Number of passwords per length.
Wait for the script to generate passwords.
Find the generated passwords in the passlist_raw.txt file.
Enjoy secure password generation with Key Combinator!
